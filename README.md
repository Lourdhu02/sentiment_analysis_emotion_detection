# Advanced NLP Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for sentiment analysis and emotion detection from tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on a dataset that contains tweets labeled with various sentiments. The goal is to predict the sentiment and emotions expressed in new tweets.

## Project Overview

This project implements sentiment analysis and emotion detection on tweets using deep learning models. The model can classify tweets into various sentiment categories such as joy, anger, sadness, and more. The project is developed using Python with TensorFlow, Keras, and other NLP libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains the following columns:
- **tweet_id**: Unique identifier for each tweet
- **sentiment**: The sentiment label (e.g., joy, anger, sadness)
- **content**: The text content of the tweet

## Model Architecture

The model employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for text data. Key components of the model include:
- **Embedding layer**: For word representations
- **LSTM layers**: For capturing the temporal dependencies in the text
- **Dense layers**: For final classification based on the learned features
- **Softmax activation**: For multi-class classification of sentiments

## Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into the model, the following preprocessing steps are applied:
- **Lowercasing**: All text is converted to lowercase.
- **Tokenization**: Text is split into individual tokens.
- **Stopwords removal**: Commonly used words that don't contribute to sentiment are removed.
- **Padding**: All sequences are padded to a fixed length to ensure uniform input dimensions.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained on 80% of the dataset, with the remaining 20% used for testing. Key metrics for evaluation include accuracy and loss, and the model's performance is validated using a validation split during training.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-emotion-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd sentiment-analysis-emotion-detection
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and place it in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

To run the model, use the following steps:

1. Preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing scripts.
2. Train the model using the provided training scripts.
3. Make predictions on new tweets by loading the trained model and using the prediction script.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the validation set, showing that it can effectively detect sentiments and emotions in tweets. The confusion matrix and precision-recall metrics are used to evaluate the performance across different sentiment categories.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- **Model optimization**: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters for better performance.
- **Additional features**: Adding more advanced NLP techniques such as BERT or GPT-based models.
- **Real-time predictions**: Deploying the model for real-time sentiment analysis via a web interface.
